				"title": "Why SolTree ?",
				"part1": {
					"heading": "Why do we need an organization like SolTree?",
					"para1": "Everything happens for a reason, both physically (Newton's second law) and mentally. There are a number of reasons to build SolTree, and ultimately it boils down to the classic “deal with the devil” that nature has offered us. In many movies and shows, the main character is offered a deal that is too good to refuse. Play ball with the bad guys, and be handsomely rewarded, or stand against them and be destroyed. This is the deal nature has offered us. A carrot or a stick."
				},
				"part2": {
					"heading": "The Carrot",
					"para1": "A world where all people have access to life's basic necessities is not utopian. It is not an impossible state of being for our society. We at SolTree believe that by complying with the rules of nature, a society where all people are free and able to thrive is possible.",
					"para2": "People who join SolTree with a carrot motivation are dreamers. They see the world we live in and know intuitively that we can do much, much better. They see the technology we have access to, and can imagine how it can be applied to manage resources more efficiently. They understand that nature is ultimately cyclical, and that to align with nature is the most rational way to be.",
					"para3": "The carrot motivation is all about creating an environment where humans can have the highest possible level of freedom. We need this freedom in order to find our purpose, and live our best, most fulfilling lives."
				},
				"part3": {
					"heading": "The Stick",
					"para1": "A world where most people do not have access to life's basic necessities, is dystopian. There are 7.8 billion people on this planet, I don't know how many of these people have access to clean water, nutritious food, and proper shelter. I would be surprised to find out it was more than half.",
					"para2": "The stick motivation is all about preventing the absolute decline of our planet and with it, our civilization. If we continue down this hyper-consumerist, greed-fueled, fear-driven path of exploitation and competition, then our situation will only get worse in the years to come.",
					"para3": "What happens when we have polluted all of the freshwater? What happens when our soil is no longer arable and we can't grow food? What do we do when the climate of the earth's breadbasket changes and we can't produce all the food we are accustomed to?",
					"para4": "When this happens, we will know the true meaning of scarcity and human nature.",
					"para5": "People who join SolTree with the stick motivation are pragmatists. They see the direction we are heading and would rather be a part of the solution. They understand that human nature is diverse. While humans are capable of great violence and destruction, we are also capable of insane creativity and are wired for mutual cooperation. People with stick motivation know we have problems that desperately need solutions."
				},
				"cta": "So what will it be, the carrot or the stick?"

			"what": {
				"title": "What is SolTree?",
				"para1": "SolTree is a community of people who wish to be free from this tyrannical economic system we are all forced to participate in. Let's break it down.",
				"para2": "In our current economic system, every person is responsible for securing food, water, and shelter for themselves and the people who depend on them. These are the most basic necessities we have, basics that humans have been struggling with since before history. Because of this simple fact, people today are forced to figure out a way to “earn a living”. This is completely antithetical to ideal freedom, a state of being where people are not forced to do anything.",
				"para3": "The people who have joined SolTree understand the fact that we are all born into a system that is not designed to lift us up, and to allow us to live our best, freest, and most fulfilling lives. The root problem we aim to solve here, is how can human beings cooperate in a way that is not inherently coercive. How can we work together to provide ourselves with not just the basics, but a high standard of living, and a fulfilling and meaningful life.",
				"para4": "We strive to find the solution by radically applying the scientific method, democratic decision making, technological capabilities, sharing resources, and most importantly, effective and respectful communication.",
				"para5": "Our founding principles are Love, Abundance, Freedom. If we operate from a base of Love so that we can effectively collaborate and create Abundance for all our members, then we will know true Freedom.",
				"cta": "How Do?"
			},
			"how": {
				"title": "How Will We Do It?",
				"heading": "How will SolTree achieve its mission of bringing all members into a state of ideal freedom?",
				"para1": "SolTree will bring freedom to all of us by applying access-based economic principles to our most fundamental basic needs. What this means, is that SolTree and everything it owns will be held in common with all members. The members will then democratically, and hopefully meritocratically, work together to find the most efficient ways to allow access to the most basic goods and services we all need.",
				"para2": "Scarcity is a fact of life, and SolTree will have to deal with this concept as well. As an example, let's say SolTree has 20 members, and recently acquired housing that can accommodate 5 people. How will we decide which 5 members can stay in the house, if all 20 own the house? The group will need to come to a consensus.",
				"para3": "Ideally, the members will allow access based on a transparent set of criteria. Allowing access to something as critical as housing is very sensitive and complicated. Some of the criteria might be, how long the individual has been a member, how much has the individual contributed to the organization, and how badly an individual needs a place to stay. Also, the organization would be wise to use an investor mindset when making these decisions.",
				"para4": "What I mean by investor mindset, is that whoever is granted access to the “free” housing will be someone who will use this increased freedom to further SolTree's goals. Put more simply, we get the most impactful people into freedom first, so that they can have an even greater impact, and allow us to bring more people into freedom.",
				"para5": "Back to our concrete example, we've now selected 5 people to live in the house. These people no longer have to worry about housing costs, and therefore are more free. Because of our selection criteria, assume that these 5 people are the most impactful and dedicated members, and they use most of their newfound free time to help SolTree.",
				"para6": "Because these people are so impactful, and are now more free to help build the organization, it grows. Now, after 6 months SolTree buys 2 more houses that can accommodate an additional 10 people. Rinse and repeat.",
				"para7": "To sum it up, SolTree will accomplish its goals by putting the most capable people into positions where they can have the biggest impact. This will increase SolTree's capabilities of providing fundamentals to all members, who when freed, will also be able to have a bigger impact. It is the magic of compound interest, but without the exploitation.",
				"para8": "Let me be clear, SolTree is a completely voluntary organization. Members will not be required to give up any of their private property in order to join and participate in SolTree. People will be rewarded based on their past, and expected future, contributions to the group. These rewards will be democratically, meritocratically, and strategically distributed in such a way as to maximize SolTree's ability to raise its members into freedom.",
